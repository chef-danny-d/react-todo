#React To-Do application

###Pub branch
This branch is under dev, might not be a stable release!!

##Purpose
The purpose behind this project is to familiarize myself with React and expand my knowledge in ES6/ES7 as well as Typescript. I do not claim ownership of this product since it is based on an online tutorial accessible by anyone. Credit goes to Traversy Media on YouTube.

##Usage
This React project is based on version 16.8.6 and the tutorial is based on 16.0.2, so there might be some slight hiccups.
